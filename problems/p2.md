# 题目
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.  

对于数列f(n):
  f(1) =1,f(2) =2
  f(n) =f(n-1)+f(n-2) (n>2)
求数列f(n)中不大于4000000且为偶数项数之和。
